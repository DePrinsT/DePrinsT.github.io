I'm a **PhD fellow in fundamental research** of the [Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be/en/), performing analyses of astrophysical observational data in the research group of [Prof. Dr. Hans Van Winckel](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=XF-c7_IAAAAJ&hl=nl) at [KU Leuven's Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. 

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
