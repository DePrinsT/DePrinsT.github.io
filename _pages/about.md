I'm a **PhD fellow in fundamental research** of the [Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be/en/), performing analyses of astrophysical observational data in the research group of [Prof. Dr. Hans Van Winckel](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=XF-c7_IAAAAJ&hl=nl) at [KU Leuven's Institute of Astronomy (IoA)](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster).

Our group focuses on observations of a specific type of **evolved low-to-intermediate mass stars**, called post-AGBs. These stars, stripped of their exterior in the preceding evolutionary phases, now rapidly contract and approach the final stages of their life.
